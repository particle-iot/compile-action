## Submitting a pull request

1. Use Node.js version specified in the `.nvmrc` file: `nvm use`
1. Configure and install the dependencies: `npm install`
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
1. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass: `npm run test`
1. Make sure your code passes lint checks: `npm run lint`
1. Update `dist/index.js` using `npm run build`. This creates a single javascript file that is used as an entrypoint for the action
1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Familiarize yourself with the code base, and follow the formatting principles adhered to in the surrounding code.
- Wherever possible, provide unit tests for your contributions.
